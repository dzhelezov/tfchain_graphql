# Tfchain graphql

[Hydra](https://docs.subsquid.io) is used to index and provide a graphql interface on toip of tfchain.

This is a project generated by `hydra-cli scaffold`. Types are defined  in  `schema.graphql` and the mappings in the `mappings` folder.

## Concept

The substrate events are processed in a multi-step pipeline:

    Tfchain => Hydra Indexer => Indexer GraphQL gateway => Hydra Processor => Database => Query Node GraphQL endpoint

## Prerequisites

* Node v14x
* Docker

## Bootstrap

```sh
yarn
yarn build
yarn db:up
yarn process
```

## Configuration

Project's configuration is driven by environment variables, defined in `.env`,
and `manifest.yml`. For more details see https://docs.subsquid.io.

## Indexer

Running an indexer is required. The indexer can be found in the [indexer folder](./indexer).

It is recommeded to use already set up indexer if available, as new indexer typically
requires some time to catch up with interesting events.

Have a look at `./indexer/docker-compose.yml` for example of how you can set up a self-hosted version.
